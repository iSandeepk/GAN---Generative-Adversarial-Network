# GAN---Generative-Adversarial-Network
Implementation of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate the fake images, by taking customized data set.

<li>
  A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is an advanced deep learning architecture comprising two neural networks that compete against each other in a zero-sum   game framework. The objective of GANs is to create new synthetic data that resembles a known data distribution.
</li>

<li>
To achieve this, GANs use a generator network that takes random noise as input and generates new data samples resembling the real data. A discriminator network then assesses both the real and generated data samples and tries to distinguish between them.

<li>
During training, the generator and discriminator networks play a "game" where the generator tries to produce increasingly realistic samples to trick the discriminator, while the discriminator aims to correctly classify each sample as real or generated. Over time, the generator improves at generating realistic samples, while the discriminator becomes better at identifying real and fake data.

Ultimately, the goal of GANs is for the generator to create samples that are indistinguishable from real data. GANs have numerous applications, including generating realistic images, music or speech, and creating new text.
